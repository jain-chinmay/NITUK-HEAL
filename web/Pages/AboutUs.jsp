        <p >NITUK-HEAL aims to bring the medical details handy. It is a true web solution with centralized 
            database where the personal and medical details of each person in the college can be maintained in a database. 
            This system is accessible to only to the Medical Officers of our institute. It allows admin to login through 
            a valid username and password and undertake various functionalities such as registering a new person & filling 
            his details, editing & updating his details, maintaining records of prescriptions provided to him, deleting an 
            existing person and searching for a person by attributes such as ID, name, blood group, health problems, 
            vaccination, counselling areas, etc. The main objective of NITUK-HEAL is to automate some of the activities 
            regarding maintaining the medical records of every person in the college. The main advantage of NITUK-HEAL is
            time saving eliminating the necessity to maintain a hardcopy of personal & medical data of each person, 
            as all this can be done through NITUK-HEALâ€™s interface very easily.</p>
